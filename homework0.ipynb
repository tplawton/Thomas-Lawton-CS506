    "_Rico recently was inspired by Uber and created his own ride-sharing company called Joyride. This company is like Uber, but only luxury cars are used to pickup and drop off people. Luckily, he has hired you, a CS 506 expert, to help him with his company._\n",

    "- `car_model` (`CarModel` enum)\n",
    "- `max_gas_tank` (float, in gallons, the maximum amount of gas the car can hold)\n",
    "- `current_gas_tank` (float, in gallons, the current amount of gas in the car's gas tank)\n",
    "- `mpg` (float, miles per gallon, how many miles the car can drive per gallon of gas)\n",
    "- `cost_per_refill` (float, in dollars, how much it costs to refill the gas tank, which is paid by Joyride)\n",
    "- `capacity` (int, number of people the car can hold)\n",
    "- `price_per_mile` (float, in dollars, how much Joyride charges passengers per mile the car has to drive. NOTE that this is independent from number of passengers in the car.)\n",
    "- `total_miles_driven` (float, in miles, how many miles the car has driven in total)\n",

    "- `license_plate` (string, the license plate of the car)\n",
    "\n",
    "_You may assume the car will never need repairs. However, as `max_miles` attribute suggests, the car will break once it has reached the maximum number of miles and cannot be repaired. Instead, the car will be thrown out and a new car will be bought._\n",

The preferences are ranked here from 1 to 3, with 1 being the most preferred and 3 being the least preferred (Here, `capacity` has the highest preference and `price_per_mile` has the lowest preference). This also means your code should work for any group of preferences given.\n",

    "**Clarifying Questions you asked Rico:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"How do I sort if the user put in a number that does not match any car?\"_\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Let's give an example of this situation. If you have a customer give a preference like\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> {\n",
    ">     \"mpg\": 90\n",
    "> }\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> But no car has exactly 90 miles per gallon, you can compute it's distance from the closest car's mpg and sort based on that. For example, if the closest car has 80 mpg, then the distance is 10 since the customer wanted 90 (90-80 = 10). If the closest car has 100 mpg, then the distance is respectively 10. You can then sort based on the distance, where the smaller distance is the more preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"What would happen if a user put in a car that does not exist in the `CarGarage`?\"_\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If this is the case, then the output should be an empty list. This is because the user's preferences cannot be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"How do I sort the CarModel values? I can't just sort the enum values.\"_\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In this situation, do the following: If the CarModel is the exact CarModel that is given in the preference, assign it a number like 1. For all the other CarModels that do not match the one in the preferences, assign them a bigger number like 2. Then, sort based on the number you assigned to each CarModel. This way, the CarModel that matches the preference will be sorted first.\n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"I'm not sure how to sort the cars based on multiple preferences in python, how do I do this?\"_\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You can manipulate the `lambda` feature from Worksheet 0.\n",
    "> You are welcome to ask ChatGPT about it or use this link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-a-list-of-objects-by-multiple-attributes-in-python/.\n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"Do I consider tie-breakers?\"_\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Nope! Don't worry about tie-breakers. If two cars have the same distance from the customer's preference, then you can just put them in any order. Similarly, if two cars have the same exact values for each field, then you can put them in any order as well.\n",
    "\n",
    ">_\"Can you give a basic example?\"_\n",
    "> Sure, consider this preferences dictionary:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> {\n",
    ">     \"car_model\": (CarModel.LEMON_LAMBORGHINI, 2),\n",
    ">     \"capacity\": (4, 1),\n",
    "> }\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Here, `capacity` is more important (priority 1) than `car_model`. To sort this, look at a given car list and see which ones are closest to capacity of 4. Then, if there is a tie, look at the `car_model`.\n",

The total profit is computed by summing up the revenue for each car in each factory. To compute this, note the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each car has a `total_miles_driven` attribute that represents how many miles the car has driven in total.\n",
    "- Each car has a `price_per_mile` attribute that represents how much Joyride charges passengers per mile the car has to drive.\n",
    "- Each car has a `cost_per_refill` attribute that represents how much it costs to refill the gas tank.\n",
    "- Each car has a `purchase_price` attribute that represents how much Joyride paid to purchase the car.\n",
    "- Each car has a `mpg` attribute that represents how many miles the car can drive per gallon of gas.\n",
    "- Each employee gets paid $10,000 (don't worry about how often).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can assume the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The car's gas is only refilled when the car hits 0 gallons of gas (don't worry about partial refills).\n",
    "- Each employee got a total of $10,000 and none of their salaries are different from one another.\n",
    "- Don't worry about the cost of gas changing over time.\n",
    "- Don't worry about broken cars; there is no need to filter those out (we need them so we can track profit here).\n",
    "- Rico's salary is not included in the total profit (so just use `num_employees` and don't adjust that number)\n",

The concept is straightforward: imagine this as a Sudoku puzzle with only the first three rows, and you need to solve it using the solution from part 'e' using backtracking. After you have solved the Sudoku for the board, you need to devise a method to randomly remove some numbers from the board you have just solved. You should aim to remove 20 to 40 items from the solved board by setting them to 0."

    "Congratulations! You have completed your first homework. Please wait to receive your grade before adding these small projects to your github - but please do consider adding them to github! If you want to extend it further, it would be a good idea to create a user interface for Sudoku, which would make it a standalone project. You can also research variations of Sudoku and incorporate them into your project. The algorithms we used here, such as DFS and recursion, are very important in various applications and job interviews."
